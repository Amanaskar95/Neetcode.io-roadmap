Welcome to my personal journey through the NeetCode.io DSA Roadmap, consisting of 150 curated Data Structures and Algorithms problems that are essential for mastering coding interviews. This repository contains:

✅ Structured solutions in a tree-like directory format

💡 Optimized code (with both brute-force and optimal approaches, where applicable)

📘 Detailed explanations and edge case handling

📊 Suitable for FAANG-level interviews, Leetcode grind, and CS fundamentals

📌 Why This Repository?
✨ To track my DSA learning progress

🧑‍💻 As a revision reference before interviews

🤝 To help others learn DSA with clean and understandable code
